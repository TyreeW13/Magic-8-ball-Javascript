Hello and welcome!

This file is a simple back end application utilizing JavaScript.
Its a magic 8 ball where the user can input a question and it will generate a response based on a set of conditional statements inside of a switch. 
It utilizes two math methods that generate a random number from 0 to 8 and gives a response based on the logic within the code. please give it a try! im also very grateful for any code improvements so please feel free to comment whatever you feel i could improve on!

have a lovely day!
